    - base64 encoded .png puzzle piece image
    - offset for mid point of tile with respect to the piece dimension
    - left/top offset for original position with respect to the puzzle board

```javascript
import jigsaw from "./jigsaw.js";

const startGame = async () => { //remove in future**
  const { board, tile, pieces } 
    = await jigsaw( imgSrcUrl, puzzleColumns, puzzleWidthPx);
  //game logic/layout code here
};
